üì¶ Manually Installing uBlock Origin
====================================

This guide explains how to manually install the **stable release of uBlock Origin** in both **Google Chrome** and the **Kiwi Browser**.  
Since newer versions of Chrome no longer allow Manifest V2 extensions by default, these steps provide a workaround.

* * *

üîß Requirements
---------------

* **Google Chrome** (desktop) or **Kiwi Browser** (Android)
    
* Access to **Chrome Flags** (for Chrome users)
    
* A stable release of [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases) (downloadable as a ZIP)
    
* Or: use the included **`ublock` folder in this repository** (based on uBlock Origin **v1.65.0**, verified working with Chrome 139)
    

* * *

üìã Installation in Google Chrome
--------------------------------

### 1. Enable Chrome Flag (required for Manifest V2)

1. Open Chrome.
    
2. In the address bar, enter:
    
    ```
    chrome://flags/#allow-legacy-mv2-extensions
    ```
    
3. Set **"Allow legacy extension manifest versions"** to **Enabled**.
    
4. Restart Chrome.
    

> üí° This step is required for running older (Manifest V2) extensions such as this uBlock build.

* * *

### 2. Get uBlock

You have two options:

**Option A: Use the provided folder in this repository**

* Simply use the `ublock` directory included here (uBlock Origin v1.65.0).
    

**Option B: Download manually**

1. Download a stable release of [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases).
    
2. Unzip the archive.
    
3. Rename the extracted folder to:
    
    ```
    ublock
    ```
    

* * *

### 3. Enable Developer Mode in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to:
    
    ```
    chrome://extensions
    ```
    
2. Toggle **Developer mode** on (switch in the top-right corner).
    

* * *

### 4. Load the Unpacked Extension

1. Click **"Load unpacked"**.
    
2. Select the `ublock` folder (either from this repo or the one you downloaded).
    

* * *

‚úÖ Chrome Done!

uBlock Origin is now installed in Chrome as an unpacked developer extension. You can use it just like the normal extension.

    * The **uBlock ZIP file** from this repository (based on v1.65.0), or
        
    * A ZIP file from the official [uBlock Origin releases](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases).
        

* * *

‚úÖ Kiwi Browser Done!
--------------------

uBlock Origin is now installed in Kiwi Browser. You can manage it under **Extensions** just like in Chrome desktop.

* * *

üìù Notes
